# ReactJS port of blockchain.bigearth.io

This is a [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) port of [blockchain.bigearth.io](http://blockchain.bigearth.io/). 

It's using [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) for routing and good ole [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for fetch the data. Nice and simple like.

It's using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to transpile [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) to CSS via the [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) and [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader).

It's also transpiling ES6 -> ES5 w/ [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and the [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/) and [React](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) presets.

There is also [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) integration for testing.
